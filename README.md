# Driver Drowsing Detection System

## (Driver Drowsiness Classification Based on Eye Blink and Head Movement Features Using the k-NN  Algorithm)

-Modern advanced driver-assistance systems analyze the driving performance to gather information about the driver’s state.

-The aim of this work is to extend the driver drowsiness detection in vehicles using signals of a driver monitoring camera. 

-Based on that large dataset, we developed and evaluated a feature selection method based on the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm for the driver’s state classification.

-A concluding analysis of the best performing feature sets yields valuable insights about the influence of drowsiness on the driver’s blink behavior and head movements.

-Here system developed using a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) is analyzed by eye blink concept through an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Euclidean distance of the eye.

-Face landmark algorithm is also used as a proper way to eye detection. When the driver’s fatigue is detected, the IoT module issues a warning message along with impact of collision and location information.

## CONCLUSION:

A model for drowsiness sensing depends on effective KNN architecture, planned to observe drowsiness based on eye closure. The implementation started preparing image datasets for both open and closed eyes. 75% of the data set is used for the custom-designed KNN training and the balance 25% of the dataset is utilized for test purposes. 

The proposed KNN gives a training accuracy of 97% and a testing accuracy of 67%. 

## FUTURE SCOPE:

The future works may focus on the utilization of outer factors such as vehicle states, sleeping hours, weather conditions, mechanical data, etc, for fatigue measurement.

Monitoring the driver’s state of drowsiness and vigilance and providing feedback on their condition so that they can take appropriate action is one crucial step in a series of preventive measures necessary to address this problem.
